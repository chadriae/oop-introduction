Instantiate an object which represents Duvel. Make sure that the color is set to blond, the price equals 3.5 euro and the temperature to cold automatically.
Also the name equal to Duvel and the alcohol percentage to 8,5%

Make all the other prints work without error.
After fixing the errors. Change the color of Duvel to light instead of blond and
also print this new color on the screen after all the other things that were already printed (to be sure that the color has changed).
Create a new private method in the Beer class called beerInfo which returns "Hi i'm Duvel and have an alochol percentage of 8.5 and I have a light color."
